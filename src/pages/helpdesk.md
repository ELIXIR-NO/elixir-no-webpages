# How to get help?

**IMPORTANT NOTE!**

**Our request tracker service through contact@bioinfo.no is
unfortunately out of order. While we are working hard to fix this
issue, kindly contact our Helpdesk heads
[David Dolan](mailto:David.Dolan@uib.no)
and [Dorota Buczek](mailto:dorota.j.buczek@uit.no) directly if you are in need of support.**

**We are very sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience!**

## Contact us by email at ~~contact@bioinfo.no~~

The request then goes out to all members of the Helpdesk and is picked
up by the one with the most expertise on the particular topic.

## Infrastructure usage instructions

ELIXIR Norway also hosts a documentation for the use of our infrastructure.
The documentation can be found [here.](https://nels-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Storage request

To apply for a storage quota, download and fill in a storage request
form (spread sheet) from [here.](https://github.com/elixir-no-nels/nels-docs/blob/main/docs/files/ELIXIR_Norway_StorageRequestForm_rev2021.xlsx)

## Support model

Projects that can be solved within two working days or less are free
of charge (enabled by funding from the Research Council of Norway).
For more comprehensive projects, an hourly rate applies and you need
to enter an [agreement](#agreement) with ELIXIR Norway on this.

Projects that require an effort beyond technical assistance/consultancy
may be set up as a research collaboration, e.g. by providing funding for
a percentage of the position of a helpdesk member.

## Agreement

For requests that require platform contribution for more than two days,
an agreement between the client and the platform must be made. The agreement
should cover type and cost of the service. If applicable, the agreement
should also cover a plan for publication and co-authorship.

Regardless of the type of contribution the platform has given to
a project, we expect to be acknowledged in resulting publications.
